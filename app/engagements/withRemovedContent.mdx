      <h2>Engagement Models & Terms</h2>
      <p>
        I help teams ship AWS serverless, data / automation platforms, and LLM automation with clear scope, timelines,
        and acceptance criteria. Below is how I typically structure engagements.
      </p>

      <h3>Offer Structure</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Build (Fixed)</strong> — Most projects start with <strong>Discovery (2–4 weeks, $7.5k–$15k)</strong> to de-risk scope, success metrics,
          and timeline. Discovery is followed by scoped delivery phases that <strong>typically start at $20k-$30k</strong> for 4–8 weeks,
          each with defined deliverables, acceptance criteria, and change control.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Co-Build (Monthly Retainer)</strong> — Ongoing product/feature work in partnership with your team.
          Advisory + hands-on implementation at <strong>$200–$250/hr</strong> with a <strong>20-hour monthly minimum</strong>
          (unused hours roll forward one month; overage billed at the same rate). Includes a shared backlog,
          weekly status, and measurable milestones.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Build &amp; Scale (Risk-Bearing Program)</strong> — For new, enterprise-level systems:
          <strong>you pay $0 until the solution is live in production, passes agreed acceptance tests, and you’re satisfied.</strong>
          After acceptance, we move to a predictable monthly fee (<strong>from $10k up to $25k+/month</strong>, depending on throughput/SLAs) as the system is monitored, scaled, and extended.
          <details>
            <summary>What kinds of builds qualify?</summary>
            <p>
              New enterprise-level systems or automation of proven manual processes where the business outcome is clear but the technology is new—
              e.g., replacing time-intensive, manual tasks with a custom, AI-assisted platform, then scaling
              beyond current manual throughput. <br/><br/>In these cases, we can design, develop, scale, monitor, and operate the system,
              including train and deploy any custom AI models or integrate with existing generative models as needed. 
            </p>
          </details>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Typical Budgets &amp; Timelines</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hourly retainers:</strong> <strong>$200–$250/hr</strong>, <strong>20-hour monthly minimum</strong> (rollover one month).</li>
        <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> <strong>$7.5k–$15k</strong> (2–4 weeks).</li>
        <li><strong>Scoped delivery phases:</strong> most start at <strong>$30k+</strong> (4–8 weeks) with clear deliverables and acceptance criteria.</li>
        <li><strong>Build &amp; Scale:</strong> post-acceptance managed program that starts at <strong>$10k</strong>
         per month and has reached over <strong>$25k/month</strong> at scale.</li>
        <li><em>Final pricing follows a short discovery to lock scope and NTE.</em></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Scope, Acceptance &amp; Change Control</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Every fixed-fee phase includes an Statement of Work (SOW) with deliverables, acceptance criteria, and a clear change-control path.</li>
        <li>Weekly status, shared backlog, and milestone reviews keep progress visible and decisions quick.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Payment Terms</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Standard <strong>Net-30</strong>; deposits for fixed-fee; invoicing monthly or at milestones.</li>
        <li><strong>Build &amp; Scale:</strong> no fee until acceptance; monthly fee begins after the agreed acceptance tests are met.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>SLAs &amp; Availability</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Defined in the SOW when needed, with documented response windows and escalation paths.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Procurement-Ready</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Entity:</strong> IterLoop <em>(Crutchfield Efficiency Solutions, LLC)</em></li>
        <li><strong>Contracts:</strong> Master Services Agreement (MSA), SOW, Data Processing Addendum (DPA)/Business Associate Agreement (BAA) (as applicable)</li>
        <li><strong>Insurance:</strong> General Liability / Professional Liability / Technology Errors &amp; Omissions; security questionnaires completed regularly</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>IP &amp; Confidentiality</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Build and Co-Build:</strong> The <strong>client owns the IP</strong> for deliverables created during the engagement.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Build &amp; Scale (risk-bearing) projects:</strong> While we carry development risk, we <strong>retain IP</strong>.
          Upon acceptance and initial payment, you receive a <strong>broad, perpetual license</strong> to use and extend the solution.
          If client-owned IP is preferred, we can structure a buyout or alternate pricing.
        </li>
        <li><strong>NDA:</strong> Available on request.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>FAQ</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fixed price?</strong> Yes—after a short discovery, with NTE and milestones.</li>
        <li><strong>Docs &amp; onboarding?</strong> Yes—runbooks, handover sessions, admin guides by default.</li>
        <li><strong>Onsite?</strong> Remote-first; onsite by arrangement.</li>
        <li><strong>Prime or sub?</strong> Available as prime contractor or specialized subcontractor.</li>
      </ul>
